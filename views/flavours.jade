h3 Organic Ice Cream

p Our goal is to create the best ice cream on the Planet. We understand to get the best result we need to use the very best ingredients. We searched the British Isles to find the perfect organic farm where the cows are extra happy. We find that happy cows give the best milk. Using only 100% natural organic cream, unrefined sugar and organic milk from Isle of Wight cows guarantees the best quality ice cream.
